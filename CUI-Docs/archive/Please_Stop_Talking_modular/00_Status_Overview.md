# Paper Status Overview: "Tasks, Not Turns"

**Current Title:** Tasks, Not Turns: Reframing Conversational Interfaces Around Persistent Task Objects
**Target Venue:** CUI 2026 (Full Paper)
**Status:** Execution Phase (Drafting)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**The Core Argument:**
Conversation is structurally ill-suited for task management because it conflates *Flow* (communication) with *State* (memory). We propose a **Task-First Interaction Model** where the primary unit of interaction is a persistent **Task Object**, not a dialogue turn.

**The Solution:**
A system that separates task state from conversational history, supported by three interaction patterns:
1.  **Pin to Task** (Keyword as Context) - Selection $\to$ Reification
2.  **Task Shelf** (Context as Inventory) - Persistence $\to$ Visibility
3.  **Context Lens** (Drag & Drop) - Composition $\to$ Activation

## 2. Chapter Status

| Chapter | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01 Abstract** | **Needs Update** | Align with "Tasks, Not Turns" title/framing |
| **02 Introduction** | **LOCKED** | Canonical text applied. Structure: Vignette $\to$ Diagnosis $\to$ Model. |
| **03 Theory** | **Stable** | "Agency Collapse" $\to$ "Task Objects" framing needed |
| **04 Empirical** | **Draft** | N=562 Analysis + 5 Archetypes (Needs breakdown taxonomy) |
| **05 Patterns** | **Draft** | Renaming to Pin/Shelf/Lens |
| **06 Architecture** | **Draft** | Needs simplified "Descriptive Model" |
| **07 Evaluation** | **Planned** | Maze Protocol ready (Berlin Trip) |
| **08 Discussion** | **Draft** | "Mode vs Replacement" focus |
| **09 Conclusion** | **Stub** | - |
