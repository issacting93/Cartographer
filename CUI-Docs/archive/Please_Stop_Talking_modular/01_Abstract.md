# Section 1: Abstract

The dominant paradigm of Generative AI interaction is "Chat"—a linear, conversational stream mimicking human dialogue. While effective for ephemeral Q&A, we argue that chat is structurally ill-suited for complex, goal-directed tasks that require the maintenance of state. We term this mismatch **Agency Collapse**: the tendency for users to gradually surrender control of the interaction as the cognitive cost of maintaining constraints in a scrolling log increases. We present an empirical analysis of 562 human-LLM interactions, revealing that 61.4% of users drift into passive "Seeker" or "Provider" roles. To address this, we propose a **Task-First Interaction** paradigm. By treating the task as a persistent object rather than a transient topic, we introduce the **Context Inventory Interface (CII)**, a system that reifies constraints as manipulable artifacts (Keywords, Inventory, Drag-and-Drop). Our formative evaluation shows that CII eliminates restatement loops ($N \approx 0$), proving that to preserve user agency, we must stop forcing users to talk to hold state.
