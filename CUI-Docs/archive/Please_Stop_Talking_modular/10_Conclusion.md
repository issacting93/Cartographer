## Content

Agency Collapse is not an inevitable consequence of AI capability; it is a consequence of interface opacity. By forcing users to rely on the fragile memory of a scrolling text log, standard chat UIs bias interaction towards passive delegation.

**To build agents that respect human agency, we must stop forcing users to talk to hold state.**
