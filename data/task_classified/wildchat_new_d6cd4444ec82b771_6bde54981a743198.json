    "reasoning": "The assistant initially provided a code structure that did not continuously update the follower's position based on the master's coordinates. The user requested modifications to ensure the follower drone updates its position every second, which indicates a repair of the constraint. The assistant's response to this request was to incorporate the necessary logic, thus maintaining the task's integrity.",
