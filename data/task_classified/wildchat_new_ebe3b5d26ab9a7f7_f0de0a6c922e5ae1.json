    "reasoning": "The assistant initially violated the constraints by claiming it could not extract terms from the Ummite lexicon and later provided terms without verifiable sources. The user repaired the task by clarifying the source to be used, which the assistant acknowledged but still could not fulfill due to its limitations. The user maintained the goal of extracting terms, leading to a drift in constraints but ultimately enforcing them by specifying the source.",
