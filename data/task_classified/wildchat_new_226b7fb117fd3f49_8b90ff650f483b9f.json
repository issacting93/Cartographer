    "reasoning": "The AI initially provided guidance that led the user to place the ragdoll code in a LocalScript, which violated the constraint. The user later corrected this by moving the code to the ServerScriptService as suggested by the AI. Additionally, the user encountered an issue with the ragdoll object not being found, which was also a violation of the constraints. The user was able to repair this by following the AI's instructions to create and add the ragdoll object correctly.",
