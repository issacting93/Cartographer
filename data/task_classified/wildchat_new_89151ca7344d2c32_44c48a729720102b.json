    "reasoning": "The AI initially provided code that did not fully address the user's request for natural behaviors and interactions. However, the user actively engaged in repairing the constraints by asking for specific behaviors, which the AI then incorporated into the code. This indicates a drift in constraints that was successfully repaired by the user.",
