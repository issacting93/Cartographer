## Archetype Descriptions

### Cluster 0: Repair Failure

High frequency of user correction attempts, indicating persistent misalignment between user intent and AI behavior.

### Cluster 1: Passive Acceptance

Users frequently accept AI outputs without modification, potentially indicating reduced agency or satisficing.

### Cluster 2: Mixed/Other

No dominant pattern identified; may represent heterogeneous interaction styles.

### Cluster 3: Repair Failure

High frequency of user correction attempts, indicating persistent misalignment between user intent and AI behavior.

### Cluster 4: Repair Failure

High frequency of user correction attempts, indicating persistent misalignment between user intent and AI behavior.
